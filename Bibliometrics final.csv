The projected current treatment, a 20% behavioral risk reduction. Results. HIV-positive CHIC increased 7.3% 9.9% 2011, whereas primary incidence flat (1.02–1.38 per 100 person-years).

Thus, malaria, classical requirement having to be although necessary, not sufficient its elimination. It also shown, using centre manifold theory, that full HIV-malaria co-infection bifurcation. Simulations show two diseases co-exist their numbers exceed unity (with no competitive exclusion occurring). Further, reduction sexual activity individuals symptoms decreases new cases mixed infection while increasing cases.
