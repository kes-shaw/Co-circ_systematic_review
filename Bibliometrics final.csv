Guidelines include a daily regimen emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) as well condom usage during sexual activity. The relationship between TDF/FTC intake and is not yet fully understood. If men who have sex (MSM,) engage high-risk activities without using condoms when prescribed they might be at an increased other sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Our study focuses on possible occurrence behavioral changes among MSM United States over time regard to usage. In particular, we interested creating model how uptake cause decline usage, causing significant increases non-HIV STD incidence, gonococcal incidence biological endpoint. We used agent-based modeling software NetLogo, building upon existing found no evidence gonorrhea prevalence due PrEP any level sample-wide range 0-90% However, did find decreased HIV, maximal effect being reached 5% 10% population PrEP. findings appear indicate that attitudes aversion, within medical community, toward promotion potential transmission are unfounded."

In particular, experimental evidence indicates that influenza infection can up-regulate expression ACE2-the receptor SARS-CoV-2 human cells-and facilitate infection. Here we hypothesized impacted during early 2020 epidemic COVID-19 Europe. To test this hypothesis, developed population-based model transmission and mortality, which simultaneously incorporated impact non-pharmaceutical control measures on epidemiological dynamics SARS-CoV-2. Using statistical inference methods based iterated filtering, confronted with mortality incidence data four European countries (Belgium, Italy, Norway, Spain) to systematically range assumptions about influenza. We found consistent for 1.8-3.4-fold (uncertainty across countries: 1.1 5.0) average population-level increase associated period co-circulation.
