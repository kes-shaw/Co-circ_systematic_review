by two different types of mosquitoes namely female anopheles for malaria and female Aedes aegypti for zika virus. Female
anopheles mosquito bite at night and at dawn and can transmit the malaria; whiles, the Aedes aegypti mosquito bite during
the day time [5] which makes prevention more complex to deal with. Elephantiasis can however be transmitted through the
bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, Aedes mosquitoes and Culux depending on the geographical location of the
vector. Although, elephantiasis and zika virus do not kill like malaria does but the stigmatization attached to the disability or
deformity in the case of elephantiasis and the microcephaly which is linked to zika virus make them more embarrassing.

consequences for the evaluation of public health campaigns aimed at changing behaviour conducive to the spread of
AIDS. If the evaluation depends on data that can largely be accounted for by the depletion of the highest risk groups, then

A comparison of the geographical distributions of HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria especially in Africa, reveal that these three diseases have similar geographical distributions suggesting a possible existence of HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria co infection.

Malaria increases the viral load in HIV/AIDS patients. Conversely HIV/AIDS increases the risk of malaria infection and accelerate the development of clinical symptoms of malaria with the greatest impact on the immune suppressed persons.
